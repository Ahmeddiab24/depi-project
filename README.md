# depi-project
Complete DevOps CI/CD Project Explanation
Project Concept
an automated CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipeline that:

Takes code from GitHub
Builds a Docker image
Pushes it to Docker Hub
Deploys it automatically to an AWS EC2 server

Every time you push code to GitHub, Jenkins automatically builds, tests, and deploys your application.
